# Microsoft SEAL Homomorphic Encryption in Python

In this repository, I'll show you Python examples for homomorphic encryption (HE) with Microsoft SEAL.

With homomorphic encryption (HE), the encrypted item can be used on computation without decryption. For sensitive data (such as, privacy data in healthcare), the customers can operate their own data without submitting private text to service providers.
